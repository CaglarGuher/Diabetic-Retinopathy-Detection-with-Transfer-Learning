# Diabetic_Retinopathy_Detection

It is an deep learning implementation for detecting diabetic disease using over 90000 eye fundus images with 15 successful CNN models using transfer learning.

The model is trained with all CNN architectures and overall accuracy is implemented to predict the 5 stages of DRD

*  level 1:No diabetic retinopathy.
*  level 2: Mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy.
*  level 3: Moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. 
*  level 4: Severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. 
*  level 5: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
